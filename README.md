# MirrorFriendlyMinimumSpanningTree
 Assignment for course 02249 on Technical University of Denmark

In this assignment we were tasked with understanding and using a problem called MirrorFriendlyMinimumSpanningTree(MFMST). The problem is a graph problem about finding a spanning tree that satisfies some requirements. The exact problem definition and assignment can be seen [here](assignment.pdf). Next we had to establish and prove the complexity class for MFMST. Finally we had to design and implement an algorithm for the associated optimization problem. Finally we also had to establish the time complexity of the algorithm we had designed. Our report can be seen [here](report.pdf).
